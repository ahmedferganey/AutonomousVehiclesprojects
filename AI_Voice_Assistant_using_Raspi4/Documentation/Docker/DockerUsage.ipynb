    "# Using Containers on Embedded Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "## Would it be a Good Idea to Use Containers on an Embedded Linux System?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some time ago, I wrote an introductory article on Linux containers. In that article, I highlighted several embedded Linux distributions based on containers, including Linux microPlatform from Foundries.io, Torizon from Toradex, and balenaOS from balena.\n",
    "\n",
    "These projects provide a Linux distribution built around a container-based infrastructure using Docker to run and manage containers. The idea is to install the distribution on your embedded hardware platform and develop or run applications inside container images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linux Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the article, I raised some questions. Are embedded systems equipped with sufficient hardware resources to run containers? How can we efficiently package cross-compiled applications and their dependencies into container images? And, how do we manage software licenses for various artifacts (base OS, container images, etc.)?\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will delve into these challenges and provide more clarity. But first, let's look at the motivations behind using containers in embedded Linux systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://sergioprado.blog/images/20200114-containers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Would We Use Containers on an Embedded Linux System?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivations for Using Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "A major motivation for using containers comes from the frustration developers face with traditional build systems. Many developers, especially those transitioning from the microcontroller world, find it difficult to grasp the concepts and tools offered by build systems such as Buildroot or the OpenEmbedded/Yocto Project. These build systems can be overwhelming, and developers sometimes want to avoid building everything from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often more productive to work with a ready-made Linux distribution. The process of creating and maintaining a customized Linux distribution with a build system is more time-consuming compared to creating container images. With containers, developers can focus on application development, spending less time managing the underlying infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, containers help extend a distribution with new applications by simply adding new container images. The availability of ready-to-use container images in Docker Hub can significantly speed up development. Containers improve productivity by simplifying deployment and management tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedded devices are increasingly part of larger, more complex solutions. A containerized infrastructure can help manage these devices more efficiently, dividing system components (such as user interface applications, web servers, databases, and network tools) into isolated containers. This makes managing the \"building blocks\" of the system (installation, uninstallation, configuration, updates) much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key advantages of containers is the ease with which they enable robust, fast, and fail-safe update systems. Since container images are easily distributable, large file transfers over networks are avoided, which is especially beneficial for devices with limited connectivity. The ability to stop and start containers effortlessly makes updating systems simpler, with reduced risk of issues. This encourages more frequent updates, improving the quality and security of the product, which in turn builds consumer confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers also allow better control over the hardware resources of a system. Fine-grained control over CPU, memory, and I/O usage can be achieved by partitioning the system's resources between containers. Each container can be isolated, with restricted permissions and controlled communication between processes, which strengthens security by reducing attack vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge that containers address is the problem of legacy applications requiring older versions of specific libraries. With containers, the application is packaged together with its dependencies, making it easier to manage different versions without the need to maintain complex execution environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, containers promote the development of modular systems that are more portable and reusable. A container image can be reused across different products and devices, provided they share the same hardware architecture and kernel compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, containers bring the technology of microservices and the culture of DevOps into the world of embedded systems!\n",
    "\n",
    "### But There Are Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the clear advantages, there are still challenges to be addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increased Resource Consumption**  \n",
    "   Containers can increase the consumption of hardware resources, particularly CPU, memory, and storage. The base Linux distribution must include components to manage and run container images (e.g., Docker engine). Additionally, as each container image is an isolated environment, this results in duplicated libraries and an increase in storage and RAM usage during execution. To mitigate this, container images must be designed with resource optimization in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flash Memory Wear and Tear**  \n",
    "   Frequent writes to the file system can wear out flash memory, which is often used in embedded systems. Embedded systems are typically designed to last for many years (often 10+ years), and excessive writes to flash memory could lead to failure or file system corruption. To combat this, efforts should be made to minimize writes to the flash device.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cross-Compiling Containers**  \n",
    "   Creating a container image for a target platform (e.g., ARMv7) with cross-compiled binaries is not a straightforward task. For example, creating a Docker container image for ARMv7 with Qt5, glibc, libusb, and a Qt5 application on an x86-64 host requires specialized tools like Docker Buildx. However, cross-compilation may not always produce optimized code for the target platform. While build systems like Buildroot or OpenEmbedded/Yocto Project can solve this, they come with their own learning curve—something many developers seek to avoid when adopting containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Some vendors are working to simplify this process. For instance, Toradex offers a plugin for Visual Studio that helps developers compile applications, package them into Docker container images, and deploy them to the target system with a single click.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating and Deploying the Final Image**  \n",
    "   Developing applications in containers is simple—just install the base image and develop within containers. However, managing changes in the base image and integrating the entire system (base Linux distribution + container images) into a final production image is more complex. A strategy for provisioning this final image in production environments is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Software License Management**  \n",
    "   A significant challenge in using containers is managing software licenses. With embedded systems relying on free software, manufacturers are obligated to provide license compliance information and source code for the software used in the product. But how do you consolidate licensing information for both the base Linux distribution and the various container images?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Version Management**  \n",
    "   Although containers make updates easier, they can complicate the management of device versions in the field. With containers, it is possible to update individual container images independently, leading to a scenario where multiple versions of a container are running on devices. This can create compatibility issues between container versions, which may result in system failures if the wrong combinations are used. A well-structured update system is required to manage container versions and dependencies effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "So, are containers the future of embedded Linux systems? The answer isn’t entirely clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The container-based approach is innovative, representing a paradigm shift that brings server-side technologies and DevOps practices to the edge of embedded systems. It’s particularly useful for rapid prototyping and for developing systems that rely on different, incompatible versions of the same libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for simpler embedded Linux projects, containers may seem inefficient. The control offered by traditional build systems like Buildroot or OpenEmbedded/Yocto Project is highly valued, especially for developers accustomed to fine-tuning their systems to optimize every byte and CPU cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, hardware is becoming more commoditized, and understanding how microservices and DevOps practices can be applied to embedded Linux systems is crucial. Perhaps I just need a paradigm shift to fully grasp the potential of containerized embedded Linux systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, only time and the market will reveal the true potential of containers in embedded Linux systems.\n"
