I. Adding the meta-docker layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the meta-docker layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the meta-docker layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-meta-docker \
    "


II. Misc
========

It is important that the you have a running docker daemon accessible for the
build as the docker image type relies on it.
